        <p> A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with
            my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
            souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
            that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I
            feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

        <p> When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the
            impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down
            among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
            noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless
            indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his
            own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity
            of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul
            and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could
            describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might
            be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for
            my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity has taken possession
            of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel
            the charm of existence in this spot.</p>
